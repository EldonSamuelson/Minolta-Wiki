### **Why are there so many SRT's?**

The US, Japanese, and 'Other' (UK/EU/ME) markets had different model names for the SRT models. This was possibly to track regional sales statistics, or to control exports. Back then it made sense, since a photographer would only see the models sold within their market. Today, with global shipping however, it makes identifying models very confusing. To make matters worse, Minolta developed the SRT throughout their production, often with minute changes and sometimes with no outward name changes at all.

Starting simply with just series name differences, the names of these changed depending on which regional market it was sold in.

### **Why do some SRT Models have different features?**

So we have the general series names, but Minolta developed the SRT throughout their production. Some have Mirror Lock Up's, Hotshoes, Split Prism Viewfinders, or Film Tab Holders, and some don't have any of these features at all! Even the CLC metering system that the SRT is known for was removed in the very latest models. It's very complicated, often confusing, and can be a real nuisance when you are looking for the 'best' SRT for you when there's 2-5 different versions of the SRT Model.

There's an entire community devoted to surveying SRT variants and you can go down a very deep rabbit hole if you want. For simplicity this compiles the information from a few resources and splits them into 6 Stages:

_Click on the models to read directly about the model and the differences (from external sources, Rokkorfiles and Minman)._

These changes were a result of balancing features available on SRT's by adding new developments whilst removing obsolete ones. This coincided with other Minolta models being released, as they didn't want an SRT to accidentally compete with the XK (1972), XE (1974/75), XK-Motor (1976), and the XG/XD (both 1977).

The SRT 101 was released whilst the old SR models were still being sold, becoming their new flagship camera. While they developed the Budget (100) and Premium (102) SRT's, they improved the shutterspeed dial and the take-up spools (Stage 1). Later as the SRT 100 and 102 were released, they removed the Mirror-Lock-Up (Stage 2) from the SRT 101 as it seemed to be a feature only 'Pros' would use on the new SRT 102. Only a year later, the SRT 102 lost it's own MLU (Stage 3) which left the XK as the only 'Pro' camera with that feature.

Stage 4 saw the introduction of the new SRT 200 series, which apart from the name-change and discontinuation of the 100 series, saw shutterspeed and hotshoe upgrades as well a Film Tab Memo holder on the filmdoor.

Stages 5, 6, and 7 came year-after-year for SRT 200's. The first cost-cutting measure was introduced which changed the metal aperture ring to plastic, and the locking Depth of Field preview mechanism become a 'push and hold' version. The next year, viewfinder focus aids were changed from a horizontal prism to split-prism which made it easier to use. The SRT 202's never saw this upgrade or any future changes, as they were discontinued. There was no reason to upgrade 202's further and put them against the new XD models, and they couldn't cheapen the model further because the SRT 201 and 200 existed below it.

The final Stage was a cost cutting measure as by then the remaining SRT's were becoming obsolete, whilst fully electronic cameras took over. They removed the 2nd metering cell in the camera, which made part of the 'CLC' system on all previous SRT's. This also meant CLC name wasn't on the prisms.

Within a year of the SRT's being discontinued entirely after 1981, the electronic X-300 (Budget/Basic), X-500 (Standard/Enthusiast), and X-700 (Premium/Pro) series came in.

### **What batteries can I use for an SRT Meter?**

When SRT cameras were released between 1966 and 1981, Mercury-Oxide batteries were already in popular use for mobile electronics because of their long shelf life, large energy capacity, and stable voltage output at 1.35 Volts. The Mercury acted as a stabiliser for the chemical reaction, so they held their charge for a very long time, and didn't explode or leak (_so often_).

The issue is that Mercury is a toxic substance - when the batteries were dumped, the Mercury leaked out of landfills and into drinking water. Workers would get sick making the batteries, and there is still no treatment for the mental and physical damage it causes. By the mid-90's, most Western countries had restricted their manufacture and banned their commercial import or use.

What replaced Mercury-Oxide was mostly Alkaline (A, AG, L, LR), Zinc-Air (ZA), or Silver-Oxide (SO, SG, SR) button cells. While they worked well in the more modern XE, XD, and X-hundred series, the different 1.55 Voltage and varying drain on these new batteries meant they couldn't work with the old SRT's system. The SRT meters didn't regulate voltage, so they would under and over expose depending whether the battery was old or new.

Since the 2000's as the remaining Mercury batteries died out, methods for working alternatives have sprung up. There are literally hundreds and thousands of webpages, articles, and forum posts giving advice, from Sunny 16 to substitution, or soldering a voltage regulator in. So, here's a summary of the common and uncommon methods I've found with links to all of them.

The table is ordered by how easy it is to complete the option - the first you could do with the camera in your hands right now. Each have their pros and cons, and the last one **is illegal** in most countries, but you can weigh the options and decide which one suits your needs (except the last one - that is objectively a bad option). Some links allow for each option's purchase, but I am not affiliated to or recommending any of them by having them on the table.

If you want to read more about each option or get into the discharge curves and details of the Mercury Battery Problem, you can read resources by [Bruce Varner](https://www.brucevarner.com/PX625Replacement.html), [Dick Sullivan](http://www.rokkorfiles.com/mercury.htm), ['Frugal' Mike](http://www.willegal.net/photo/srt/srt-mercury.htm), [KniPPsen](https://knippsen.blogspot.com/2016/02/px625-und-alternativen.html),[Mel](https://high5cameras.com/all-articles/spares-and-upgrades/whose-got-the-power-a-guide-to-classic-camera-batteries/), and [PhotoEthnography](http://www.photoethnography.com/ClassicCameras/batteries.html). [F. de Gruijter (PDF)](http://rick\_oleson.tripod.com/batt\_adapt\_us.pdf) is probably the most detailed and authoritative on the issue, and the technical differences between battery types.

Alongside the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, there's also environmental & health concerns for disposal of and exposure to Mercury, and the legal consequences for purchasing and/or importing a banned product containing toxic material.

### **Do all Minolta's suffer from Capacitor issues?**

Placeholder text - In short, no. XD's, XE's, XK's, SRT's and SR camera don't have capacitor issues. _They can still fail and stop working_, of course, but capacitors are not expected to be the cause of failure in those models.

The models to be aware of for capacitors are;

* **All XG-series cameras.** These were the budget replacement for the ageing SRT line-up. They had to use cheaper ALEC/Electrolytic capacitors to keep costs down in their consumer-focused camera. They didn't expect people to keep using them 45 years on!
* **All X-500/570 and X-300/370 series cameras**, for the same reason as the XG series. They were the budget alternative to the X-700, so they weren't expected to be used for long (40 years).
* _**Most**_** X-700 series cameras.** In the first few runs of the camera, The X-700 was given the expensive more reliable STEC/Tantalum capacitors because it was the 'Pro' camera which was expected to be reliable. Unfortunately the Tantalum material got more and more expensive, until it was no longer feasible to continue their manufacture. That means _very early_ X-700's below serial no. 20xxxxxx got reliable capacitors and don't have issues, but all later serial numbers got the less reliable ones.

These are not set-in-stone truths, however. As time goes on, people get their cameras repaired. You might find any of these cameras with a freshly replaced capacitor from today. These are still ALEC capacitors, but with far better reliability than ones built 50 years ago.

## Lens FFAQ's

***

### **What do the letters mean on my MC Rokkor Lenses?**

As you might have already seen on your lenses, [some Minolta lenses](http://minolta.eazypix.de/lenses/index.html) have 2-letter suffixes after 'Rokkor'. If you're very fortunate, you might even have an earlier Auto-Rokkor or an original SR lens with two letters like '_PF_'.

It can't be to identify the lens, because if I was talking about the 'MC Rokkor _PF_' lens, it could be a 135mm, 100mm, 85mm, 58mm, 55mm, 53mm, or 50mm. That's a lot of PF's! It also can't be a grading system, as the 16mm f/2,8 'MC Fish-Eye Rokkor _OK_' is better than ok, it's actually really good. It can't be a manufacturing location either, as the 21mm 'MC W.Rokkor _NL_' lenses were made in Japan, not the Netherlands.

Silly jokes aside, it's about the Elements and Groupings of the glass inside the lens. The first letter is tied to how many _Groups_ of Elements there are, following the mathematical designation:

The P in '_PF_' means 5 Groups.

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th align="center">1st Grouping Letter</th><th align="center">T</th><th align="center">Q</th><th align="center">P</th><th align="center">H</th><th align="center">S</th><th align="center">O</th><th align="center">N</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Math Designation*</td><td align="center"><em>Tri</em></td><td align="center"><em>Quad</em></td><td align="center"><em>Pent</em></td><td align="center"><em>Hex</em></td><td align="center"><em>Sept</em></td><td align="center"><em>Oct</em></td><td align="center"><em>Non</em></td></tr><tr><td align="center"># of Groups</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">9</td></tr></tbody></table>

\* _If this doesn't make sense, think of polygons. Pentagon, Hexagon, Septagon, etc._

Then the second letter covers the amount of _Elements_ in the lens and is simply tied to the letters' position in the Alphabet:

The F in '_PF_' means 6 Elements

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th align="center">2nd Element Letter</th><th align="center">C</th><th align="center">D</th><th align="center">E</th><th align="center">F</th><th align="center">G</th><th align="center">H</th><th align="center">I</th><th align="center">J</th><th align="center">K</th><th align="center">L</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"># of Elements</td><td align="center">3</td><td align="center">4</td><td align="center">5</td><td align="center">6</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">11</td><td align="center">12</td></tr></tbody></table>

So if P means _Penta_ groups and the F means 6 Elements, the Lens has 6 Element in 5 Groups!

You might be asking yourself, 'What can I do with this information now, does that mean anything for quality?' and the answer is 'sort of'. Earlier original SR lenses like the 35mm W.Rokkor QE (5 Elements in 4 Groups) were slower at f/4 compared to the later MC W.Rokkor HH (8 Elements in 7 Groups) at f/1.8. You also see this with the MC-Rokkor PG lenses with 1 extra Element being \~1/3 of a stop faster than their PF counterparts, but then the focus is harder to make at that extra stop gained because it gives a narrower Depth of Field.

For later MD lenses this information isn't helpful, as no MD Lens has this naming feature. You'd have to look up that information online, but then you'd find many MD Lenses have _less_ Elements and Groups than their earlier MC counterparts, but are faster or considered generally better. This is because of their more advanced glass coatings which came later with the MD lenses.

If you want to read more about it, you can check out Minolta Lens Designations by [Dennis Lohmann](http://minolta.eazypix.de/lenses/index.html#clas) or by [Henrik Robeck](http://minolta.rokkor.de/lensdesignations.htm). You can also read more generally into Minolta Lenses by [Rokkorfiles](http://www.rokkorfiles.com/Lens%20History.html) and [Minman](https://web.archive.org/web/20211021170337/http://www.subclub.org/minman/slrlens.htm) which refer to the Lens Designations and their eventual removal when MC III (aka 'Rokkor-X') and MD lenses started production.

### **Are any Minolta lenses radioactive?**

From geiger counter testing by members of the Minolta Collectors' Group on Facebook, there are known to be 4 radioactive lenses made by Minolta.

These 4 are radioactive because their glass elements contained Thorium or Lanthanum, periodic Elements that have a high [refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive\_index). Thorium/Lanthanum glass reduced Chromatic Aberrations, by stopping light splitting and dispersing as it passes through the glass (think _Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd_). As as side effect, it made the lenses mildly radioactive since the glass could be made of up the 30% of radioactive Elements. Based on these lens surveys however, they are only _very mildly_ radioactive. We'll ge to that later.

All of this data in these tables was by researched members of the [Minolta Collector's Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/minoltacollectors/permalink/5314503005255341/), and the original post by Maury J. goes more into detail on the general methodology for measuring radioactivity.

#### **Is the 85mm f/1.7 Lens Radioactive too?**

There were unsubstantiated [rumours](https://web.archive.org/web/20120414014001/http://www.dg77.net/photo/x500/mc85.htm) that a fifth lens (an MC Rokkor 85mm f/1.7) might be radioactive, however no proof has ever shown a radioactive 85mm lens made by Minolta. What makes this claim dubious is that it cited that an MC-I version of the 85mm lens is radioactive, when there isn't an [85mm MC-I model in existence](http://minolta.eazypix.de/lenses/index.html).

Unfortunately the myth of a radioactive 85mm lens persisted and spread, including being reproduced on the Rokkorfiles website.

\* _20 were surveyed, including an extremely early production serial number of the lens (SN 2501007, #7), yet none were found to be radioactive. This source is considered reliable as Han F. operates the_ [_Minolta Manual Lens List_](http://minolta.eazypix.de/lenses/index.html)_, and has surveyed many other radioactive Minolta lenses._

#### **Are Radioactive Lenses Dangerous?**

These lenses have been proven to be radioactive. But are they dangerous? Not at all. These are measured with the detector right up to the glass, whereas the strength of radioactivity decreases rapidly with distance from the source. At 1 metre/3 feet away from the back of the lens pointed at you, there is no detectable radioactivity. If you put the lens cap on or mounted it on a camera, the radioactivity distance would be reduced to just that space inside. If they were emitting serious radioactivity, the lenses would be damaging the film inside the camera.

For a [comparison of Radioactivity](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Radiation\_Dose\_Chart\_by\_Xkcd.png), an average daily Background Radiation dose is between 2-10 μSv, a Dental X-Ray is 5 μSv, a Chest X-Ray is 20 μSv. A yearly dose that is clearly linked to increased cancer is 100 _m_Sv. Let's do some math;

100 mSv / 6 μSv per hour = 16,666 Hours, or 694 Days. So even if you strapped the rear element of an MC Rokkor-PG 58mm lens to your body for a complete year, you couldn't increase your risk of cancer. You are safe.

### **Can I adapt other lens mounts to Minolta SR/MC/MD?**

Officially, Minolta provided support for only 3 lens mounts, with a simple letter-based adapter system;

* [**'P' Adapter**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/ivpziv/finally\_scored\_an\_original\_m42\_to\_minolta\_md/) - For **P**raktica M42 screwmount. This was a simple adapter that only allowed for stop-down metering. The lens would be pre-set at the aperture when the meter was taken and the shutter released.
* [**'E' Adapter**](https://randomphoto.blogspot.com/2007/06/minakta-or-exolta.html) - For **E**xakta bayonet mount. Similar to the P-Adapter, the lenses could only be used with the aperture pre-set, for stop-down metering only.
* [**'L' Adapter**](http://forum.mflenses.com/minolta-adaptersoriginal-p-and-l-adapters-t36916.html) - This was for **L**eica's Thread Mount (LTM), otherwise known as M39 screwmount. This was [specifically designed or use with a bellows for Macro photography and copying](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/854299015217676299/1087095128042250340/Screenshot\_2023-03-19\_201107.png). As such, stop down metering was required, and even focus was controlled via the bellows instead of focusing the lens. You would attach the bellows to the camera through the regular Minolta SR-mount, then attach the L-Adapter to the bellows.

Today you can find cheap adapters for various mounts from 3rd Party Vendors. Many use glass corrective elements to adapt the lens to Minolta SR, and as a result don't produce good results.

There is no way to adapt modern DSLR/Mirrorless lenses to Minolta SR, however.

### **Can I adapt Minolta (SR/MC/MD) lenses to Minolta and Sony A-Mount?**

There are Minolta/Konica Minolta/Sony A-Mount to Sony E-Mount adapters, and Minolta SR/MC/MD to Sony E-Mount adapters, but Minolta SR/MC/MD to Minolta A-Mount adapters are very uncommon. Konica Minolta and Sony didn't even bother making them by their period of ownership.

That said, Minolta did make official 'M/A Converters', an ['M/A-S' for lenses <300mm](https://www.mhohner.de/sony-minolta/onelens/ma\_s), and an ['M/A-L' for 300mm and above](https://www.mhohner.de/sony-minolta/onelens/ma\_l). They adapt a manual SR lens to A mount, but also act as x2 teleconverters (i.e. An MD 50mm f/1.7 becomes functionally 100mm f/3.5 when adapted). You can read more about them [here](https://www.clubsnap.com/threads/minolta-2x-m-a-converter-s-another-bridge-to-use-old-minolta-manual-lenses-on-alphas.1058857/). These would be an excellent adapter with very little loss in image quality. These are rare to find nowadays, but they can be found on Ebay for €99. Just search '[Minolta M/A Converter](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?\_from=R40&\_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&\_nkw=Minolta+M%2FA+converter&\_sacat=0)' and you will eventually find a few.

There were also 3rd party ones offered by Sigma in the 1980's, and some unbranded ones by another company. There's not as much information on these, but you can read more about what adapter/converters were available on [Dyxum](https://www.dyxum.com/lenses/teleconverters.asp) (you have to scroll to the bottom, to the Manual Focus Converters section).

There are also the cheap and common modern adapters by [Fotodiox](https://www.amazon.de/Fotodiox-Adapter-Minolta-Mount-Cameras/dp/B0048A8CDU) that teleconvert by x1.4 (i.e. 50mm becomes \~70mm), but these are of lower quality and won't be as good as they add a cheap glass element to adapt them.

To summarise, your options are :

* The official and expensive adapters if you have some Minolta/Konica Minolta/Sony A-Mount bodies, but don't want to buy copies of your older Minolta manual focus lenses or upgrade your body to an E-mount.
* The 3rd party cheap adapter(s) if you just want to try out the lenses on A-mount but don't plan on using them often, and/or don't care about a loss in image quality.

The alternative option if you plan to get an E Mount camera anytime in the future; There are many MD to E Mount adapters that don't use corrective glass or teleconvert the focal length. They have their own cost vs quality considerations. You can read more about these from [Phillip Reeve's Blog](https://phillipreeve.net/blog/guide-adapters-minolta-mc-md-lenses/).

### **'F.W. Rokkor' Lenses, what are they?**

Placeholder. Not much known about them, suspected to be old copy-projection lenses for 70's Minolta office photocopiers. See [here](https://forum.opticallimits.com/showthread.php?tid=5259) for the best information anyone knows about them.

### **What's the deal with 'Minolta Digital'?**

Placeholder text. In short, there was a manufactured Trademark dispute involving US Patent Law, and Minolta (Konica Minolta) lost. The trademark was then passed to another company, and they proceeded to sell crappy hybrid cameras under a '[Zombie Trademark](https://attorneyatlawmagazine.com/zombie-trademark)'

If they are considered 'Minolta', then I have an Minolta-brand bridge to sell you. Don't buy them, at best they have no relation to old Minolta, and at worst are the modern-era equivalent of a '[scamera](https://mikeeckman.com/2019/04/canon-dl-9000-the-scamera/)'.
